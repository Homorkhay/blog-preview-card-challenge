### What I learned

It's been months since I did anything related to coding & programming. Thanks to this project, I gained back my confidence and I learned new stuff the transform: translate() property to center a div.

Before I quit coding & programming for a while, I'm already learning grid . I would have taken up a better project on frontendmentor  I want to further my learning with SASS css preprocessor and use it for my next project.
